# AGENTS.md

Working instructions for coding agents changing this repository. Read this first, then follow the shared contribution rules in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). This document is short on purpose and links to the longer guides instead of repeating them.

Yakumo is a native port of *Monster Hunter Portable 3rd HD Ver.* (`NPJB-40001`). It recompiles the game's PSP (MIPS) code to C++ ahead of time and supplies the PSP system around it: the kernel, HLE modules, a Vulkan GE renderer, audio, input, save data, ad hoc networking and an ImGui interface. The C++ lives in `profiles/mhp3rd/host/` (the port) and `include/psprecomp/` plus `src/` (the reusable runtime and recompiler).

The [profile README](profiles/mhp3rd/README.md) covers player settings, environment variables, controls, saves, mods and networking. For device-specific testing in a developer's environment, also read [LOCAL_TESTING.md](LOCAL_TESTING.md) when present, as described below.

[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) describes private vulnerability reporting and security fixes. Read it when investigating a suspected vulnerability.

[CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) describes expected community behavior and maintainer responsibilities in repository discussions.

## Rules

- **English only** in everything committed: code, comments, docs, commit messages, pull requests. The only exceptions are the translations `README.ru.md` and `README.es.md`, and they change in the same pull request as `README.md`.
- **Branch and pull request.** Never push to `main`. Pull requests are merged by rebase; keep a clean, reviewable commit series.
- **No game data, ever.** Disc images, `EBOOT`/`DATA.BIN` contents, the generated code (`profiles/mhp3rd/generated/`), overlay corpora, and saves stay local; they are ignored by Git. The same goes for anything personal: home paths, user names, machine names, addresses.
- **Write it yourself.** Read public documentation and other projects to understand the PSP, file formats and protocols. Never copy, paste or line-by-line translate code from a project whose licence is incompatible with this repository's MIT licence. Constants, offsets and format facts are fine. Record where intentionally included third-party code comes from; see [SOURCE_PROVENANCE.md](docs/SOURCE_PROVENANCE.md).
- **Tests accompany behavior changes.** Add regression tests for fixes and success/failure/boundary tests for new behavior. Run the full relevant suites; changed executable lines must reach 80% coverage. Record hardware/game-data gaps and manual evidence. Documentation and mechanical changes need suitable verification rather than artificial tests. Follow [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#testing-changes) and [COVERAGE.md](docs/COVERAGE.md).
- **Say what you did not verify.** A pull request lists what was tested, on which platform, and what was not.

## Building without waiting hours

[docs/BUILDING.md](docs/BUILDING.md) is the full guide. A full build from a fresh clone takes about two hours on an M1 and longer on weaker machines. Most of that can be skipped:

- **Generated code.** Copy `profiles/mhp3rd/generated/` from a checkout that already has it with a plain `cp -R`, not a copy that keeps old timestamps.
- **Overlays.** Don't rebuild them per checkout: `MHP3RD_OVERLAY_DIR=/path/to/out/mhp3rd/bin/overlays`. This is safe while `include/psprecomp/` is unchanged.
- **ccache.** Install it; the build uses it automatically, across checkouts.
- **Game data.** Set `MHP3RD_GAME_DIR` to a game directory instead of running `prepare_game.sh` in every clone.
- **Host-only changes rebuild in seconds.** Changes under `include/psprecomp/` rebuild everything, including all 355 overlays, so avoid them unless they are the point.
- **Build commands.** Build with `cmake --build`, never `ninja` directly: `cmake --build` holds the per-directory lock. Run one build per build directory. Keep parallelism low (`-j2`), because generated units need gigabytes of memory each. Never delete `.ninja_deps` or `.ninja_log`.

## Running and testing

- **Bound every run.** `timeout 60 out/mhp3rd/bin/Yakumo`. Never leave a game running, and never drive it with an open-ended input loop, such as pressing confirm forever: it does not converge, and someone may be watching the screen.
- **Quick boot checks.** `MHP3RD_NO_RENDER=1 MHP3RD_NO_AUDIO=1 timeout 40 …`, then look for the function count and `[overlay] installed` in the output.
- **Scripted input and captures.**
  - `MHP3RD_INPUT_SCRIPT` sends keys, virtual gamepad input and dropped files, and captures the window. The syntax is in `profiles/mhp3rd/host/ui/input_script.hpp`.
  - `MHP3RD_SCREENSHOT_DIR` captures the game's own frames.
  - Look at the captures; don't assume.
- **Several instances.** For multiplayer or before/after comparisons, give each instance its own `MHP3RD_DATA_DIR`, its own saves, and an `MHP3RD_WINDOW_TITLE`.
- **Numbers.**
  - `MHP3RD_PERF=log` prints one line per second: fps, the game's own frame rate, emulation speed, and guest/render/wait time.
  - Speed must stay at 100%; the game runs at 30 frames per emulated second.
- **Tracing.**
  - `MHP3RD_TRACE_*` variables log one subsystem each: GE, material and lighting registers, save data, fonts, pad, audio, ATRAC, MPEG, ad hoc, I/O, kernel.
  - All the variables are listed under *Diagnostics* in the [profile README](profiles/mhp3rd/README.md#diagnostics).
- **Unit tests.** `cmake --build out/mhp3rd --target psprecomp_test_binaries -j2 && ctest --test-dir out/mhp3rd`.
- **Manual smoke test.** [TESTING.md](docs/TESTING.md), about fifteen minutes. [COMPATIBILITY.md](docs/COMPATIBILITY.md) records results per platform, always with the commit that was tested.

## Local test setup

Each developer can keep their own [LOCAL_TESTING.md](LOCAL_TESTING.md) at the repository root to describe available test devices, access methods, build paths, launchers and prebuilt overlays. If it exists, read it before testing in that environment. The file is intentionally ignored by Git: keep device addresses, personal paths and machine-specific notes there, never in committed documentation. Its absence is normal in a fresh checkout; use the public build and testing guides instead.

Reuse compatible prebuilt overlays for development and release packaging. Rebuild them only when a change requires it; check the runtime headers and overlay compatibility first. Where separate developer and release installations exist, use the developer installation for tests. Follow the local guide for device-specific workflows and leave release installations and personal launcher configuration alone unless asked to change them.

## Lessons that cost real time

- **Trace the hardware; don't recall it.** GE register numbers, PSP struct layouts and HLE semantics taken from memory have been wrong, and each wrong guess cost a debugging session. Add or use a `MHP3RD_TRACE_*` switch and read what the game actually does.
- **Measure before changing.** Find the cause with a trace, a profile or a number, then change code. Successive guesses at a rendering bug from screenshots failed four times in a row.
- **Compare like with like.**
  - Compare a known-good build and yours at the same frame of the same scripted run.
  - A model that isn't on screen yet looks the same in a broken and a working build.
  - The guest clock is seeded from the wall clock, and a connected gamepad changes input, so pin both when you need pixel-identical runs.
- **Give new behaviour an off switch.** An environment variable that restores the old behaviour lets anyone compare both on the same screen.
- **Logs.** stdout redirected to a file is block-buffered. A truncated last line means the buffer hasn't been flushed, not that the program has stopped.
- **The game's view differs from the host's.** A value the game reads every frame (a buffer count, a status word) must mean exactly what it means on a PSP. A wrong one breaks things far from where it is read. Ad hoc quests dropped because a byte count grew instead of reporting what was waiting.
- **Performance problems in the renderer are usually memory reads.** Resolve guest memory once per draw, not per element. Profile with `perf` (Linux) or Instruments (macOS) before optimising.
- **Long builds on a handheld.** Keep it on its charger and block suspend while the build runs: a suspend during a large build can hang the machine. Start long jobs detached (`systemd-run --user …`), so a dropped SSH session doesn't kill them.

## Pull requests

- Open a draft pull request early and push after every commit that builds. Work that exists only locally is lost when a session ends.
- The description says what changed and why, how it was verified (platform, commit, what you looked at), what was not verified, and which issues it closes or references.
- Update the docs that the change makes wrong: the profile README for settings and variables, `docs/BUILDING.md` for the build, and `docs/COMPATIBILITY.md` for verified results.
